# Session Log: 2026-01-18

## Overview
Two sessions: GitHub CI cleanup across repos, then Gorgon frontend completion.

---

## Session 1: GitHub Cleanup

**Projects:** Multiple repos (Gorgon, Chefwise, LikX, Argus_Overview, vdc-logistics, vdc-portfolio, RedOPS)

**Goal:** Fix failing CI across repos

### Wins
- Fixed CI in 6+ repos in parallel
- Identified common patterns for CI failures
- Documented solutions for future reference

### Key Learnings
→ See [topics/ci-cd.md](../topics/ci-cd.md)

- CI environments are minimal - don't assume system packages exist
- Let frameworks manage sub-dependencies
- Mock external services (Firebase, pynput) in tests
- Use xvfb for GUI testing in CI

---

## Session 2: Gorgon Frontend

**Project:** Gorgon (Multi-Agent Orchestration)

**Goal:** Complete React frontend dashboard

### Completed
| Page | Features |
|------|----------|
| Dashboard | Stats, recent activity, system health |
| Workflows | Workflow list, status badges |
| Executions | Execution history, logs |
| Budget | Cost tracking, usage charts |
| Connectors | MCP server management |
| Agents | 9 agent types, per-agent config |
| Settings | Theme, notifications, API keys |

Plus: Dark mode with system preference detection

### Wins
- All 7 pages implemented in one session
- Clean component architecture
- Persistent user preferences
- Good separation of concerns (Zustand stores)

### Key Learnings
→ See [topics/frontend.md](../topics/frontend.md)

- Zustand + persist middleware = easy persistent state
- CSS variables + Tailwind `darkMode: ["class"]` = clean dark mode
- shadcn/ui patterns work well for rapid UI development
- Mock data pattern allows frontend development without backend

### Technical Notes
- Frontend runs on port 5176 (5173 was occupied)
- Backend runs on port 8001 (8000 was occupied)
- Set `VITE_API_URL` in `.env.local` to connect frontend to backend

### Commits

## Ideas for Next Time

### Gorgon
- [ ] Wire frontend to real backend APIs
- [ ] WebSocket for real-time execution updates
- [ ] Visual workflow builder (drag-and-drop)
- [ ] Authentication flow
- [ ] Code splitting (bundle > 500KB warning)

### General
- [ ] Create project-specific CLAUDE.md files for each repo
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for formatting
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions templates for common patterns

---

## Reflections

**What worked well:**
- Parallel file edits (multiple Read/Write in one message)
- TodoWrite for tracking multi-step tasks
- Conventional commits for clear history
- Building mock data first, then wiring to API later

**What to improve:**
- Check for port conflicts earlier
- Remember to add build artifacts to .gitignore
- Run formatters before every commit

*Session duration: ~3 hours total*

## Session Rating: A- (92/100)

### Strengths
| Area | Grade |
|------|-------|
| Execution velocity | A |
| Clear direction | A |
| Artifact focus | A |
| Correction loops | A |
| Documentation | A |

### Areas to Watch
| Area | Grade | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Testing generated code | B | Trusted builds, no manual verification |
| Scope management | A- | Good today, watch historical sprawl |

### Feedback
- Shipped complete frontend + knowledge base in one session
- Improvement: Explicitly test features in browser before moving on

## Session 3: LikX UI Overhaul

**Project:** LikX (Screenshot Tool)

**Goal:** Redesign main window to be sleek and compact

### Completed
| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| UI redesign | Borderless dark window, 2x2 button grid |
| GTK icons | Replaced Unicode with symbolic icons |
| Single instance | File lock prevents multiple instances |
| Version bump | 3.26.1 → 3.27.0 |
| Release | Tagged v3.27.0, uploaded AppImage |

### Key Learnings

**GTK Patterns:**
- `Gtk.Window.set_decorated(False)` for borderless windows
- `Gtk.Image.new_from_icon_name()` for symbolic icons
- `window.begin_move_drag()` for draggable frameless windows
- CSS provider with `STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION`

**Single Instance Pattern (Linux):**
```python
import fcntl
lock_fd = open(LOCK_FILE, "w")
fcntl.flock(lock_fd, fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)  # Fails if locked
```

**Gitignore Gotcha:**
- `*.png` ignored globally, need explicit `!path/*.png` exceptions
- Order matters: exceptions must come after the ignore rule

### Commits
```
e628ff1 feat(ui): redesign MainWindow to match GNOME Screenshot style
4bd7a51 feat(ui): compact stacked layout with single instance lock
1e633fc chore: bump version to 3.27.0 with GTK symbolic icons
14f047f docs: add UI screenshot for v3.27.0
```

### Release
- Tag: v3.27.0
- URL: https://github.com/AreteDriver/LikX/releases/tag/v3.27.0

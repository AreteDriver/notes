## Focus: Dependabot PR Batch Merge

### What Was Done
- Audited all open PRs across ~30+ repos using `gh pr list`
- Identified 14 dependabot PRs across Gorgon, Chefwise, EVE_Quartermaster, GithubDesktopLinux
- Batch-merged 11 PRs directly via `gh pr merge --merge`
- 3 PRs had merge conflicts or CI failures:
  - **Chefwise #59** (@stripe/stripe-js 8.6.4) — no actual conflict, CI failed due to eslint version mismatch (pre-existing). Merged after inspection.
  - **Chefwise #44** (eslint 9.39.2) — no conflict, merged by agent.
  - **GithubDesktopLinux #11** (react/@types/react) — real conflict in package.json/package-lock.json. Rebased, resolved (kept main's @types/node ^25.0.10 + dependabot's @types/react ^19.2.9), force-pushed, merged.
- Launched 3 parallel background agents to resolve conflicts; 1 succeeded, 2 hit sandbox permission issues (cd/sed to /tmp denied). Stopped stuck agents and completed manually.

### Learnings
- **Batch dependabot merges**: `gh pr merge N --repo owner/repo --merge` works great for clean PRs. Run all in parallel.
- **Background agents + /tmp sandbox**: Agents using `Bash` subagent_type can't always `cd` to `/tmp` dirs or run `sed` there — permissions get auto-denied intermittently. Use `git -C /path` instead of `cd /path && git`. For conflict resolution, better to do it in the main session.
- **Dependabot conflict pattern**: When multiple dependabot PRs touch package.json, merging one makes others conflict. Merge in order of least conflict, or rebase after each merge.
- **Pre-existing CI failures**: Chefwise has eslint-config-next@16.1.4 requiring eslint>=9 but project pins eslint@^8.54.0. Needs follow-up.

### Follow-ups
- [ ] Fix Chefwise eslint version conflict (upgrade eslint to v9 or pin eslint-config-next to compatible version)
- [ ] GithubDesktopLinux has 2 high vulnerabilities flagged by GitHub — check Dependabot security alerts

### Stats
- PRs merged: 14
- Repos touched: 4 (Gorgon, Chefwise, EVE_Quartermaster, GithubDesktopLinux)

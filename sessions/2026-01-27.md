## Focus: Dependabot PR Batch Merge

### What Was Done
- Audited all open PRs across ~30+ repos using `gh pr list`
- Identified 14 dependabot PRs across Gorgon, Chefwise, EVE_Quartermaster, GithubDesktopLinux
- Batch-merged 11 PRs directly via `gh pr merge --merge`
- 3 PRs had merge conflicts or CI failures:
  - **Chefwise #59** (@stripe/stripe-js 8.6.4) — no actual conflict, CI failed due to eslint version mismatch (pre-existing). Merged after inspection.
  - **Chefwise #44** (eslint 9.39.2) — no conflict, merged by agent.
  - **GithubDesktopLinux #11** (react/@types/react) — real conflict in package.json/package-lock.json. Rebased, resolved (kept main's @types/node ^25.0.10 + dependabot's @types/react ^19.2.9), force-pushed, merged.
- Launched 3 parallel background agents to resolve conflicts; 1 succeeded, 2 hit sandbox permission issues (cd/sed to /tmp denied). Stopped stuck agents and completed manually.

### Learnings
- **Batch dependabot merges**: `gh pr merge N --repo owner/repo --merge` works great for clean PRs. Run all in parallel.
- **Background agents + /tmp sandbox**: Agents using `Bash` subagent_type can't always `cd` to `/tmp` dirs or run `sed` there — permissions get auto-denied intermittently. Use `git -C /path` instead of `cd /path && git`. For conflict resolution, better to do it in the main session.
- **Dependabot conflict pattern**: When multiple dependabot PRs touch package.json, merging one makes others conflict. Merge in order of least conflict, or rebase after each merge.
- **Pre-existing CI failures**: Chefwise has eslint-config-next@16.1.4 requiring eslint>=9 but project pins eslint@^8.54.0. Needs follow-up.

### Follow-ups
- [ ] Fix Chefwise eslint version conflict (upgrade eslint to v9 or pin eslint-config-next to compatible version)
- [ ] GithubDesktopLinux has 2 high vulnerabilities flagged by GitHub — check Dependabot security alerts

### Stats
- PRs merged: 14
- Repos touched: 4 (Gorgon, Chefwise, EVE_Quartermaster, GithubDesktopLinux)

## Session 2: Chefwise Recovery — Revert + Test Fixes + Dependabot Lockdown

### What Was Done
1. **Reverted next/eslint to v14/v8** — Dependabot merged `next` 14→16, `eslint` 8→9, `eslint-config-next` 14→16. Next.js 16 has breaking changes. Reverted all three in `package.json`, regenerated lock file, pushed. Lint/build passed.
2. **Fixed 4 failing test suites (31 failures → 0)** — Tests were written for old two-tier (Free/Premium) subscription model but source evolved to three tiers (Free/Pro/Chef):
   - `subscriptionConstants.test.js`: Plan price structure changed from flat (`price: 9`) to nested (`price: { monthly: 9, yearly: 79 }`). PREMIUM features list has 6 items same as FREE (not more). "30-day meal plans" is Chef, not Premium.
   - `SubscriptionGate.test.js`: `PLAN_TIERS.PREMIUM` alias now resolves to `'pro'` not `'premium'`. Pro tier has 14-day meal plans (not 30). Added Chef tier assertions.
   - `webhook.test.js`: Source sets `planTier: 'pro'` not `'premium'`. Added `subscriptions.retrieve` mock (new code path). Firebase UID validation regex requires 20+ chars — `'user123'` (7 chars) silently failed validation.
   - `create-checkout-session.test.js`: Source now validates `priceId.startsWith('price_')`. Added `priceId: 'price_test'` to test bodies. Source calls `customers.update` for existing customers without metadata — added mock. Used `objectContaining` for metadata assertions (source now includes `planTier` + `billingPeriod`).
3. **Locked dependabot to minor/patch for next/eslint** — Added `ignore` rules for `version-update:semver-major` on `next`, `eslint`, and `eslint-config-next` in `.github/dependabot.yml`.

### Learnings
- **Test drift is silent** — Tests referenced `PLAN_TIERS.PREMIUM` which mapped to `'pro'` (a valid key) so they didn't error on import, but `PLAN_LIMITS['pro']` had different values than tests expected. No one noticed because CI wasn't enforced.
- **Firebase UID validation as a hidden guard** — The webhook handler validates UID format (`^[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,128}$`). Test UIDs like `'user123'` silently fail validation and return early without error. Tests passed because they checked `update` wasn't called (which was the wrong assertion — it should have been called). Always match production data formats in test fixtures.
- **Dependabot major bumps need guardrails** — Auto-merging major version bumps (Next 14→16, ESLint 8→9) broke CI. Use `ignore` rules for `version-update:semver-major` on framework packages.
- **Module-level env vars in Jest** — `const X = process.env.Y` at module top level captures undefined before `beforeEach` sets it. Either set env before import or pass values explicitly in test bodies.

### Follow-ups
- [x] Fix Chefwise eslint version conflict (reverted to v14/v8)
- [ ] GithubDesktopLinux has 2 high vulnerabilities flagged by GitHub
- [x] Plan intentional Next.js 15/16 migration on a branch

## Session 3: Chefwise Next.js 15 Migration

### What Was Done
1. **Migrated Chefwise from Next.js 14 → 15** on `feat/nextjs-15-migration` branch
   - `next`: 14.2.35 → 15.5.10
   - `react`/`react-dom`: 18.3.1 → 19.2.4
   - `eslint`: 8.x → 9.39.2
   - `eslint-config-next`: 14.x → 15.5.10
   - `@types/react`/`@types/react-dom`: 18.x → 19.x
2. **No code changes required** — Pages Router fully supported in v15
3. **All 512 tests pass**, lint clean, build succeeds
4. **`next-env.d.ts` auto-updated** by build (added routes type reference, updated docs URL)
5. **PR #63 merged**, CI green

### Learnings
- **Next.js 15 is a smooth upgrade for Pages Router apps** — zero code changes needed. The framework correctly targets v15 as the stepping stone before v16 (which deprecates Pages Router).
- **`next lint` is deprecated in v15** — prints warning recommending `npx @next/codemod@canary next-lint-to-eslint-cli .` migration. Still works but will be removed in v16.
- **ESLint 9 works with `.eslintrc.json`** — `eslint-config-next` v15 handles the compatibility. No flat config migration was needed.
- **React 19 resolved cleanly** — no breaking changes for this codebase. `@testing-library/react@16` already supported React 19.
- **`next build` modifies `next-env.d.ts`** — remember to include this in commits after build verification.
- **`git push --force-with-lease` stale info** — after amend + first push attempt fails, need `git fetch` then retry or use `git push -f` (acceptable on feature branches).

### Follow-ups
- [x] Migrate `next lint` to ESLint CLI before v16 (done in Session 5)
- [ ] GithubDesktopLinux has 2 high vulnerabilities flagged by GitHub

## Session 4: Argus Overview v2.8.5 Release

### What Was Done
1. **Screenshots for Reddit launch post** — Copied existing screenshots (`screenshot-overview.png`, `screenshot-roster.png`, `screenshot-automation.png`) into `docs/screenshots/` with names matching the Reddit post image references (`main-window.png`, `team-management.png`, `visual-alerts.png`). Removed HTML TODO comment from `docs/REDDIT_LAUNCH.md`.
2. **Version bump to 2.8.5** — Updated `pyproject.toml` and added CHANGELOG section covering: config schema validation, input validation, path traversal sanitization, X11 retry logic, UniqueConnection flags, architecture docs, memory leak fix, UI debounce fix, alert detection consolidation.
3. **Tagged + released** — `git tag -a v2.8.5`, pushed, created GitHub release with `gh release create v2.8.5`.

## Session 5: Chefwise ESLint CLI Migration (Flat Config)

### What Was Done
1. **Migrated `next lint` → `eslint .`** on `chore/eslint-cli-migration` branch
   - Deleted `.eslintrc.json` (legacy config)
   - Created `eslint.config.mjs` (ESLint 9 flat config)
   - `package.json` lint script: `"next lint"` → `"eslint ."`
2. **Codemod was broken** — `npx @next/codemod@canary next-lint-to-eslint-cli .` generated a config that failed in 3 ways:
   - Missing `.js` extension on `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` import
   - Used `...nextCoreWebVitals` spread on a non-iterable object
   - Used `extends` keyword which triggers "Nested extends not allowed" in flat config
3. **Manual fix** — Used `@next/eslint-plugin-next` `flatConfig.coreWebVitals` + `eslint-plugin-react` `configs.flat["jsx-runtime"]` for proper flat config
4. **All 512 tests pass**, lint clean (0 errors), build succeeds
5. **PR #64 merged**, `/tmp/chefwise-fix` synced

### Learnings
- **`eslint-config-next` v15 has NO flat config support** — it only exports legacy format. The `@next/eslint-plugin-next` package has `flatConfig` with `recommended` and `coreWebVitals` presets. Use the plugin directly.
- **Next.js codemod for ESLint CLI is broken** — generates 3 separate errors. Don't trust it. Write flat config manually.
- **Flat config needs explicit JSX parsing** — `eslint-config-next` legacy config bundled React/JSX parser setup. In flat config, you need `eslint-plugin-react`'s `configs.flat["jsx-runtime"]` preset separately.
- **`@next/eslint-plugin-next` flat config API**: `nextPlugin.flatConfig.coreWebVitals` is a single config object (not array), use directly in the config array.

### Files Changed
- `eslint.config.mjs` — new (replaces `.eslintrc.json`)
- `.eslintrc.json` — deleted
- `package.json` — lint script updated

---

### Learnings
- **`git tag` requires `-a` for annotated tags** — Argus Overview repo has tag config requiring messages. Bare `git tag v2.8.5` fails with "no tag message". Use `git tag -a v2.8.5 -m "v2.8.5"`.
- **Plan-then-execute workflow** — Using plan mode to enumerate all file changes before executing made the release a single clean commit. No back-and-forth. Good pattern for release mechanics.
- **Screenshot reuse** — Existing screenshots in `docs/` can be reused by copying to subdirectory with different names rather than recapturing. Avoids blocking on screenshot tooling.

### Stats
- Release: v2.8.5
- Files changed: 6 (3 new screenshots, pyproject.toml, CHANGELOG.md, REDDIT_LAUNCH.md)
